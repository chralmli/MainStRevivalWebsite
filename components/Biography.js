                    The band has made a notable impact on the Norwegian live scene. 
                    They have performed at some of Norway&apos;s biggest blues festivals, including the Notodden Blues Festival and Blues In Hell, and have won the hearts of many fans. 
                    This led to them being chosen as the opening act for WigWam at Byscenen in Trondheim in 2023.

                    with two podium finishes in the Norwegian Championship in blues and a second place in TM Live 2022.
